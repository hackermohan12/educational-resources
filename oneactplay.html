                     <p>This one-act play features an <span class="kw-person">Earnest Young Woman</span> confronting a <span class="kw-person">Famous Actress</span> (<span class="kw-person">Sara</span>), accusing the <span class="kw-person">actress</span> of having an <span class="kw-theme">affair</span> with her husband, <span class="kw-person">Alfred</span> (a <span class="kw-person">lawyer</span>). The <span class="kw-person">Young Woman</span> presents <span class="kw-concept">evidence</span> like <span class="kw-imagery">flowers</span> sent by <span class="kw-person">Alfred</span> and a <span class="kw-imagery">love letter</span> she found. The <span class="kw-person">Famous Actress</span> initially denies everything but then cleverly twists the <span class="kw-concept">narrative</span>. She convinces the <span class="kw-theme">naive</span> <span class="kw-person">Young Woman</span> that <span class="kw-person">Alfred</span> isn't actually in love with the <span class="kw-person">Actress</span>; rather, he is merely pretending to have an <span class="kw-theme">affair</span> to make his own wife <span class="kw-theme">jealous</span> and win back her affection, a ploy supposedly common among theatre-associated <span class="kw-person">men</span>. The <span class="kw-person">Earnest Young Woman</span>, completely <span class="kw-theme">fooled</span>, realizes her "mistake," apologizes profusely, and leaves relieved. The <span class="kw-concept">ironic twist</span> comes immediately after she exits: the <span class="kw-person">Famous Actress</span> calls out to <span class="kw-person">Alfred</span>, who emerges from her personal <span class="kw-place">bedroom</span> (<span class="kw-place">boudoir</span>), revealing that the <span class="kw-theme">affair</span> was real all along, and the <span class="kw-person">actress</span> masterfully deceived the wife. The play <span class="kw-concept">satirizes</span> <span class="kw-theme">naivety</span>, marital <span class="kw-theme">infidelity</span>, and the <span class="kw-theme">deceptive</span> nature of appearances, especially in the world of theatre.</p>

                        <div>The play shows a '<span class="kw-concept">split personality</span>' mostly in the <span class="kw-person">Famous Actress</span>. She acts one way (kind, helpful) to the <span class="kw-person">Earnest Young Woman</span>, but her real actions are different (she's having an <span class="kw-theme">affair</span> and hiding the husband). It's like she has two sides: the innocent role she plays and the <span class="kw-theme">deceptive</span> person she really is. This difference makes it seem like a '<span class="kw-concept">split</span>'.</div>

She's a very skilled <span class="kw-person">actress</span> in life, not just on stage. She is <span class="kw-concept">clever</span>, <span class="kw-theme">cunning</span>, and very good at <span class="kw-concept">lying</span> convincingly.

She uses her skills to easily <span class="kw-theme">fool</span> the trusting <span class="kw-person">Earnest Young Woman</span>.

                     <p>Set in <span class="kw-place">Nepal</span> in <span class="kw-time">1854 B.S.</span> (<span class="kw-time">Ashwin</span>), this one-act play <span class="kw-concept">satirizes</span> the <span class="kw-concept">feudal system</span> during the reign of <span class="kw-person">King Ranabahadur Shah</span>, who was obsessed with bulls. The play opens with two panicked <span class="kw-person">cowherds</span>, <span class="kw-person">Gore</span> and <span class="kw-person">Jitman</span>, rushing to <span class="kw-person">Laxminarayan</span> (a legal officer and the king's bull doctor) to report the death of the king's favorite bull, <span class="kw-person">Male</span>. All three fear the king's severe punishment, possibly death. <span class="kw-person">Laxminarayan</span>, remembering past punishment (lips burned, mustache non-existent on one side), advises caution. He instructs the <span class="kw-person">cowherds</span> not to say the bull is dead, but ill. <span class="kw-person">Laxminarayan</span> goes to the <span class="kw-place">palace</span> and informs the <span class="kw-person">king</span> the bull is sick, describing symptoms and praising the bull's past glory. The <span class="kw-person">king</span> decides to see the bull himself. At the <span class="kw-place">cowshed</span> in <span class="kw-place">Thulo Gauchar</span>, <span class="kw-person">Laxminarayan</span> tells <span class="kw-person">Gore</span> and <span class="kw-person">Jitman</span> to pretend to care for the dead bull (massaging feet, fanning) when the <span class="kw-person">king</span> arrives. The <span class="kw-person">king</span> observes the motionless bull and declares it dead himself. To save themselves, <span class="kw-person">Jitman</span> and <span class="kw-person">Gore</span> erupt in exaggerated displays of grief, claiming the bull was dearer than family, impressing the <span class="kw-person">king</span> who rewards them with tips (400 & 500 rupees) and tells them to be quiet. <span class="kw-person">Laxminarayan</span> also feigns agony. The <span class="kw-person">king</span> orders <span class="kw-person">Laxminarayan</span> to handle the burial and rites. <span class="kw-person">Gore</span> and <span class="kw-person">Jitman</span> are immensely relieved to be alive. The play powerfully critiques the <span class="kw-theme">dehumanization</span> under <span class="kw-concept">feudalism</span>, where <span class="kw-person">servants</span> live in terror and an animal's life is valued over human well-being, forcing people into <span class="kw-concept">sycophancy</span> and <span class="kw-theme">deception</span> for survival.</p>

                        <div>Yes, <span class="kw-person">Bhimnidhi Tiwari</span>'s "The Bull" is definitely a strong <span class="kw-concept">satire</span> against the <span class="kw-concept">feudal system</span> prevalent in <span class="kw-place">Nepal</span> during the <span class="kw-time">late 18th century</span> (Shah period, similar in nature to the later Rana period). <span class="kw-concept">Satire</span> uses humor, exaggeration, or irony to criticize foolishness or wrongdoing.<br><br>The play shows the absurdity of the system through extreme exaggeration. The <span class="kw-person">king</span>, <span class="kw-person">Ranabahadur Shah</span>, cares immensely more for his bull, <span class="kw-person">Male</span>, than for his human subjects.

Their desperate attempts to hide the truth, the elaborate pretence of caring for the dead bull (massaging its feet, fanning it), and their fake, exaggerated crying to please the <span class="kw-person">king</span> highlight the system's irrationality and <span class="kw-theme">cruelty</span>. The massive rewards given for this fake grief further satirize the ruler's vanity and the system's flawed values.<br><br>Through these exaggerated situations, Tiwari criticizes the <span class="kw-theme">dehumanizing</span> power of feudal lords and the climate of <span class="kw-theme">fear</span> they created.</div>

The practice of <span class="kw-theme">chakari</span> (<span class="kw-theme">flattery</span> to gain favour) was essential for survival. The play also hints at the low status of women through <span class="kw-person">Laxminarayan</span>'s casual mention of having seven wives. Overall, it depicts a society where common humans were <span class="kw-theme">dehumanized</span>, living in constant anxiety under a powerful, unpredictable ruler whose priorities heavily favoured status and pets over people.</div>

The <span class="kw-person">king</span> <span class="kw-person">Ranabahadur Shah</span>'s obsession with his bull, <span class="kw-person">Male</span>, is exaggerated.

The play sharply criticizes the <span class="kw-concept">feudal</span> society by showing the huge difference in treatment between the <span class="kw-person">King</span>'s pet bull, <span class="kw-person">Male</span>, and his human subjects.<br><br>The bull receives extra care: it eats <span class="kw-imagery">fine rice</span> and special soup (even if it can't digest it), sleeps on a <span class="kw-imagery">mattress</span> with a quilt and <span class="kw-imagery">mosquito net</span>, has a personal doctor (<span class="kw-person">Laxminarayan</span>), and its death causes extreme panic among the caretakers.
