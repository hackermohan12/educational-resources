                     <p>The story follows a <span class="kw-person">young couple</span> who move into a <span class="kw-place">new home</span> in a <span class="kw-place">suburban neighbourhood</span> densely populated with <span class="kw-person">European immigrants</span>. <span class="kw-time">Initially</span>, they feel uneasy and perceive their <span class="kw-person">neighbours'</span> customs (like the <span class="kw-person">Macedonian family's</span> <span class="kw-imagery">yelling</span> or the <span class="kw-person">Polish widower's</span> <span class="kw-imagery">hammering</span>) as strange. The <span class="kw-person">neighbours</span> also find the <span class="kw-person">couple</span> odd, particularly the <span class="kw-person">young man</span> staying home to write his <span class="kw-concept">thesis</span> while his wife works. However, barriers begin to break down in <span class="kw-time">autumn</span> when the <span class="kw-person">couple</span> starts a <span class="kw-imagery">garden</span> and receives help. The <span class="kw-person">widower</span> rebuilds their failed <span class="kw-imagery">henhouse</span>. Over time, the <span class="kw-person">couple</span> overcomes their <span class="kw-theme">prejudices</span> as they interact more, learning skills like slaughtering from the <span class="kw-person">Macedonians</span>. When the <span class="kw-person">woman</span> becomes <span class="kw-time">pregnant</span>, the <span class="kw-person">neighbours</span> notice before the <span class="kw-person">couple</span> tells anyone and shower them with <span class="kw-imagery">gifts</span> and well wishes. The <span class="kw-time">birth of the baby</span> brings the entire <span class="kw-theme">community</span> together. At this moment, the <span class="kw-person">young man</span> cries, realizing his earlier <span class="kw-theme">prejudices</span> and understanding that his academic <span class="kw-concept">thesis</span> hadn't prepared him for the human connections and realities of real life. The story highlights how <span class="kw-theme">cultural and linguistic barriers</span> can be overcome by <span class="kw-theme">community</span>, <span class="kw-theme">love</span>, and <span class="kw-theme">compassion</span>, showing the positive contribution of <span class="kw-person">immigrants</span> to <span class="kw-place">Australia's</span> social fabric and how <span class="kw-theme">prejudice</span> stems from a lack of knowledge.</p>

Going to the <span class="kw-place">USA</span> on a scholarship was also very impressive.

The danger feels more like an exciting game. In "The Treasure in the Forest", the focus is on the characters' terrible <span class="kw-theme">greed</span>.

                <div class="space-y-4 text-base md:text-lg">
                     <p>The story unfolds as a dialogue (told via <span class="kw-concept">stream of consciousness</span>/<span class="kw-concept">monologue</span>) between a foreign <span class="kw-person">tourist</span> and a <span class="kw-person">Nepali guide</span> in the <span class="kw-place">Kathmandu Valley</span>. It explores perceptions of <span class="kw-place">Nepal</span> through eyes - literal and metaphorical. The <span class="kw-person">tourist</span>, knowledgeable about <span class="kw-place">Nepal</span>, initially offers to guide the <span class="kw-person">guide</span> ("I could take you along your ancient ways"), but the <span class="kw-person">guide</span> subtly asserts his deeper understanding. They discuss <span class="kw-place">Kathmandu's</span> beauty, <span class="kw-concept">history</span> (<span class="kw-person">Manjushri</span>, Chobhar), religious artifacts, <span class="kw-concept">cultural diversity</span> (<span class="kw-person">Aryans</span>, non-Aryans, <span class="kw-person">Hindus</span>, <span class="kw-person">Buddhists</span> living in <span class="kw-theme">tolerance</span>), food, and historical figures (Bhrikuti, Amshuvarma). The <span class="kw-person">tourist</span> is charmed by the welcoming smiles of the Nepalese people. The core theme revolves around different kinds of eyes: eyes in windows, door panels, stupas, the "<span class="kw-concept">samyak gaze</span>" (pure perception) of monks, the eyes of the Himalayas, and the <span class="kw-concept">half-closed eyes of the Buddha</span>, symbolizing peace, wisdom, and watchfulness over the land. The <span class="kw-person">guide</span> contrasts the idealized view with harsh <span class="kw-theme">reality</span> by taking the <span class="kw-person">tourist</span> to a <span class="kw-place">remote village</span> to see a poor <span class="kw-person">farmer's family</span> and their <span class="kw-person">paralyzed child</span>. The child's body is useless except for his eyes, which express deep <span class="kw-theme">faith</span>, connection, <span class="kw-theme">kindness</span>, and thankfulness when the parents believe the <span class="kw-person">tourist</span> is a doctor. The <span class="kw-person">guide</span> connects this to the eyes of the <span class="kw-place">mountains</span> and <span class="kw-place">fields</span>, representing the land's beauty and resilience. The story contrasts Western knowledge with local <span class="kw-theme">reality</span>, highlighting <span class="kw-place">Nepal's</span> <span class="kw-theme">tolerance</span>, coexistence, cultural richness, and the profound meaning seen through different 'eyes'.</p>

                     <p>During a <span class="kw-imagery">rainstorm</span>, <span class="kw-person">Pelayo</span> finds an <span class="kw-person">old man</span> with <span class="kw-imagery">enormous wings</span> stuck in the <span class="kw-imagery">mud</span> in his <span class="kw-place">courtyard</span>. The man looks decrepit and speaks an unknown language. A <span class="kw-person">neighbour woman</span> declares him an angel who likely fell while coming for <span class="kw-person">Pelayo</span>'s sick child. <span class="kw-person">Pelayo</span> and his wife <span class="kw-person">Elisenda</span> lock the "angel" in the <span class="kw-place">chicken coop</span>. Their child recovers overnight. <span class="kw-person">Father Gonzaga</span>, the priest, is skeptical, noting the angel's undignified appearance and lack of Latin. News spreads, and crowds flock to see the angel. <span class="kw-person">Elisenda</span> starts charging admission (5 cents), and they become wealthy. The crowd treats the angel poorly, poking him and throwing stones. He endures passively until burned with a <span class="kw-imagery">branding iron</span>, then reacts angrily. Interest wanes when a travelling carnival arrives with the <span class="kw-person">Spider-Girl</span>, whose story is more engaging and accessible. The angel is forgotten and lives for years in the dilapidated <span class="kw-place">chicken coop</span>, later moving to a shed and wandering the house, much to <span class="kw-person">Elisenda</span>'s annoyance. He grows weak and seems near <span class="kw-theme">death</span> but recovers, his feathers regrow. One day, <span class="kw-person">Elisenda</span> sees him awkwardly attempting to fly, and watches, relieved, as he finally manages to gain height and disappears over the horizon. The story employs <span class="kw-theme">magical realism</span>, blending the mundane and the fantastic, to explore themes of <span class="kw-theme">human cruelty</span>, <span class="kw-theme">greed</span>, <span class="kw-theme">faith</span>, patience, and the way people react to the inexplicable or miraculous.</p>

At the beginning, it's been raining heavily, making everything <span class="kw-imagery">muddy</span> and damp. A key part of the setting is the wire <span class="kw-place">chicken coop</span> where the <span class="kw-person">old man</span> is kept prisoner. Later, they build a bigger house, but the feeling remains quite ordinary, contrasting with the strange visitor.</div>

Most importantly, he didn't understand Latin, which the priest thought was God's language. He seemed more like a very old, worn-out person than a divine being from heaven.</div>

They throw things, pull his feathers out, and even <span class="kw-theme">burn</span> him with a hot <span class="kw-imagery">branding iron</span>. They don't seem to care about his pain.
