                     <p><span class="kw-person">Oliver Sacks</span> recounts his lifelong <span class="kw-theme">love affair with books and libraries</span>, starting from his <span class="kw-time">childhood</span> home's <span class="kw-imagery">oak-panelled library</span>. Both his parents were <span class="kw-concept">literature</span> enthusiasts, influencing his early immersion in books. He fondly remembers the <span class="kw-place">Willesden Public Library</span> as a place of <span class="kw-concept">self-discovery</span>, preferring active reading there to passive learning in formal school. His interests evolved towards <span class="kw-concept">science</span> (<span class="kw-concept">astronomy</span>, <span class="kw-concept">chemistry</span>), leading him to specialist libraries like the <span class="kw-place">Science Museum's library</span> and later, university libraries like the <span class="kw-place">Radcliffe Science Library</span> and the <span class="kw-place">Bodleian Library</span> at <span class="kw-place">Oxford</span>. His most beloved library was at <span class="kw-place">Queen's College, Oxford</span>, where he explored ancient texts and <span class="kw-time">17th/18th-century</span> writings. Moving to <span class="kw-place">New York</span>, he found solace and productivity in the library at <span class="kw-place">Albert Einstein College of Medicine</span>. <span class="kw-person">Sacks</span> emphasizes the library as a space for quiet <span class="kw-concept">companionship</span>, exploration, and deep connection through shared <span class="kw-concept">knowledge</span>. He laments the shift in the <span class="kw-time">1990s</span> where students began ignoring bookshelves for <span class="kw-concept">computerized access</span>, leading to the <span class="kw-theme">discarding of physical books</span>, which he views as a tragic "destruction of centuries of <span class="kw-concept">wisdom</span>." He believes <span class="kw-theme">digital literature</span> cannot fully replace the priceless nature and inspirational quality of physical books.</p>

                        <div><span class="kw-person">Oliver Sacks'</span> essay "On Libraries" is truly a celebration of the unique benefits libraries offer, especially <span class="kw-concept">intellectual freedom</span>, a sense of <span class="kw-concept">community</span>, and the joy of <span class="kw-concept">serendipitous discovery</span>.<br><br>He contrasts the rigid structure of school, which he disliked, with the <span class="kw-concept">freedom</span> libraries provided. There, he could choose any book, follow any path of interest, and learn actively at his own pace – this was his <span class="kw-concept">intellectual freedom</span>. <span class="kw-person">Sacks</span> also valued the library's social aspect, describing the "quiet companionship" of readers on their own quests and the potential for conversations and friendships to start among the <span class="kw-imagery">shelves</span> – a subtle form of <span class="kw-concept">community work</span>. Finally, he highlights the pure joy of <span class="kw-concept">serendipity</span>, the "ecstasy of wonderful discovery." He loved wandering the <span class="kw-imagery">stacks</span>, never knowing what "unexpected treasures" he might find, like the works of <span class="kw-person">Theodore Hook</span> or the old book Megrim that inspired his own writing.</div>

                        <div>In "On Libraries," <span class="kw-person">Oliver Sacks</span> makes a clear distinction when he says, "I was not a good pupil, but I was a good learner." This statement is justified by his descriptions of his education.<br><br>He explains he disliked school because it required being a passive pupil: sitting still, receiving instructions, letting information flow "in one ear and out by the other." He wasn't good at this structured, passive way of absorbing facts dictated by teachers. However, he was an excellent learner because he was deeply curious and needed to be active in his education. He found his "real education" in <span class="kw-place">libraries</span> like <span class="kw-place">Willesden</span>. There, he could actively roam, choose subjects that fascinated him (like <span class="kw-concept">science</span>), follow his own paths, and absorb <span class="kw-concept">knowledge</span> deeply because he was personally engaged. He learned best by exploring independently, not by being told what to learn.<br><br>Thus, his success came from self-directed, active learning in <span class="kw-place">libraries</span>, proving he was a 'good learner' even if he didn't fit the mold of a 'good pupil'.</div>

                     <p><span class="kw-person">Stephen L. Nock's</span> essay examines <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> as a <span class="kw-concept">social institution</span>, particularly its impact on <span class="kw-person">men</span> and its changing role due to social and demographic trends. He argues <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> is not just a private matter but a major <span class="kw-concept">social structure</span> with well-understood <span class="kw-concept">rules</span> and connections to other institutions (family, law, economy). <span class="kw-person">Nock</span> asserts <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> holds special significance for <span class="kw-person">men</span>, helping them develop and express <span class="kw-theme">masculine identity</span> and providing <span class="kw-concept">structure</span> to their lives. He notes that <span class="kw-concept">normative marriage</span> (in the <span class="kw-place">US</span> context) traditionally involves voluntary entry by mature heterosexual adults, husbands as primary earners, fidelity, and parenthood. <span class="kw-concept">Marriage</span>, especially for <span class="kw-person">men</span>, correlates with better physical and mental health and transforms <span class="kw-person">men</span> regarding achievement, social involvement, and well-being. The essay touches upon debates around strengthening <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> and addressing modern societal problems like limitless desires for well-being, suggesting <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> provides important boundaries and <span class="kw-concept">social capital</span> (networks built on trust).</p>

Like money (physical capital) or skills (human capital), <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> provides resources.

The main reason is that <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> is a formal <span class="kw-concept">social institution</span> with widely understood <span class="kw-concept">rules</span>, expectations (like faithfulness, long-term commitment), and legal status. Other relationships, like <span class="kw-concept">cohabitation</span>, often lack these clear, socially recognized <span class="kw-concept">rules</span> and <span class="kw-concept">structures</span>, giving partners more <span class="kw-concept">freedom</span> but less built-in support or guidance.</div>

                        <div><span class="kw-person">Stephen L. Nock</span>, in his essay "Marriage as a Social Institution," describes <span class="kw-concept">normative marriage</span> in the <span class="kw-place">USA</span> using six key features or dimensions. These represent the traditional ideal or standard.<br><br>First, <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> is entered <span class="kw-concept">voluntarily</span> by the individuals. Second, it involves <span class="kw-concept">mature adults</span>. Third, traditionally, it is between <span class="kw-concept">heterosexual</span> adults (a man and a woman). Fourth, there's an expectation that the <span class="kw-person">husband</span> will be the <span class="kw-concept">main earner</span> for the family. Fifth, sexual <span class="kw-concept">faithfulness</span> between the partners is a core rule and expectation. Finally, the sixth dimension is that married partners are expected to become <span class="kw-concept">parents</span> and raise children together. Although not all marriages fit this perfectly today, <span class="kw-person">Nock</span> argues these six points still form the basic, socially understood blueprint or <span class="kw-concept">norm</span> for <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> in American society.</div>

                        <summary class="text-lg md:text-xl">What is cohabitation? Explain the advantages of cohabitation over normative marriage.</summary>
                        <div><span class="kw-concept">Cohabitation</span> means two people living together and having a sexual relationship without being legally married. In "Marriage as a Social Institution," <span class="kw-person">Nock</span> contrasts this with <span class="kw-concept">normative marriage</span>.<br><br>The main advantage of <span class="kw-concept">cohabitation</span>, as suggested in the essay, is <span class="kw-concept">freedom</span> from the strict <span class="kw-concept">rules</span> and expectations that come with <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span> as a <span class="kw-concept">social institution</span>. Cohabiting partners have more flexibility to decide how they want to arrange their relationship – how to handle money (pooled or separate), how to deal with parents, or whether to take vacations together. They are not bound by the traditional assumptions and legal ties of <span class="kw-concept">marriage</span>. This lack of a fixed "template" allows them to create their relationship more personally and perhaps avoid some pressures associated with <span class="kw-concept">normative marriage</span>. However, the essay also notes this lack of <span class="kw-concept">structure</span> means less built-in guidance or social support.</div>

He argues that <span class="kw-concept">knowledge</span> alone, without <span class="kw-concept">wisdom</span>, can be <span class="kw-theme">harmful</span>. Examples include medical advances reducing infant mortality leading to overpopulation, or <span class="kw-concept">knowledge</span> of atomic physics leading to nuclear weapons. <span class="kw-concept">Wisdom</span> involves factors like a <span class="kw-concept">sense of proportion</span>, <span class="kw-concept">comprehensiveness</span> (awareness and feeling), <span class="kw-concept">emancipation</span> from personal prejudice, <span class="kw-concept">impartiality</span>, and understanding human needs.

He suggests teaching should include not just facts (<span class="kw-concept">knowledge</span>) but also the consequences of actions, like the harm caused by hatred or misuse of technology (e.g., atomic bombs). Education should encourage thinking about the bigger picture and understanding different viewpoints, helping students develop fairness (<span class="kw-concept">impartiality</span>) and <span class="kw-concept">empathy</span>.</div>

It's not just about separate moral lessons, but about connecting facts to real-life values and consequences.<br><br>He suggests that while teaching any subject, educators should incidentally point out the broader context and potential impacts. For example, when teaching the <span class="kw-concept">science</span> of atoms (<span class="kw-concept">knowledge</span>), a teacher should also discuss the devastating effects of atomic bombs (<span class="kw-concept">wisdom</span> about consequences and human life). When teaching history, instead of just facts, teachers can discuss the harm caused by prejudice and hatred, encouraging <span class="kw-concept">impartiality</span>. He also mentions the importance of teaching understanding over hate, using the example of learning to see enemies (like the <span class="kw-person">Samaritans</span>, or modern equivalents) as fellow humans with flaws, rather than just objects of hate.<br><br>Essentially, teaching <span class="kw-concept">wisdom</span> involves encouraging a <span class="kw-concept">sense of proportion</span>, showing connections between different fields, fostering <span class="kw-concept">empathy</span>, and promoting <span class="kw-concept">freedom</span> from personal bias within the regular curriculum.</div>

                        <div>According to <span class="kw-person">Bertrand Russell</span>, the very <span class="kw-concept">essence of wisdom</span> is freeing oneself, as much as possible, from being trapped by personal feelings, immediate surroundings, and selfish desires ("the tyranny of the here and now"). It involves seeing things <span class="kw-concept">impartially</span>, understanding wider perspectives beyond one's own immediate experience, and giving due importance to things remote in time or space.<br><br>One acquires this essence, <span class="kw-person">Russell</span> suggests, through both intellect and feeling. Intellectually, it requires <span class="kw-concept">knowledge</span> and <span class="kw-concept">comprehensiveness</span> – understanding many factors and their connections. Emotionally, it requires developing <span class="kw-concept">empathy</span> and reducing <span class="kw-concept">egoism</span>. We learn to care about broader human goals and the well-being of others, not just ourselves. Education plays a role by teaching <span class="kw-concept">impartiality</span> and the consequences of narrow-mindedness. Experience and reflecting on life also help us gain a better <span class="kw-concept">sense of proportion</span> and detach from purely personal biases.<br><br>Therefore, acquiring <span class="kw-concept">wisdom</span>'s essence is a gradual process of widening one's thoughts and feelings beyond the self, achieved through learning, understanding, <span class="kw-concept">empathy</span>, and seeking fairness.</div>

                     <p><span class="kw-person">Yuval Noah Harari's</span> essay "Humility" argues that most cultures lack <span class="kw-concept">humility</span>, instead displaying <span class="kw-concept">egoism</span> and illusions of superiority. He contends that basic human traits like <span class="kw-concept">morality</span>, <span class="kw-concept">art</span>, <span class="kw-concept">spirituality</span>, and <span class="kw-concept">creativity</span> are universal, encoded in our DNA, not exclusive to any single group. However, many cultures believe they are the <span class="kw-concept">center of the universe</span> and the originators of history and key innovations (e.g., <span class="kw-person">Greeks</span> tracing history to <span class="kw-person">Homer</span>, <span class="kw-person">Indians</span> claiming ancient nukes, <span class="kw-person">Jews</span> crediting themselves with monotheism, <span class="kw-person">Chinese</span> nationalists asserting primacy). <span class="kw-person">Harari</span> debunks these claims, pointing out that most significant ideologies (like monotheism, originating in <span class="kw-place">Egypt</span>) existed elsewhere before being adopted and aggressively spread by surviving faiths. He highlights the irony that many faiths preach against <span class="kw-concept">egoism</span> yet exhibit extreme <span class="kw-concept">self-centeredness</span> by claiming unique importance or chosen status (like <span class="kw-person">Jews</span> viewing gentiles as less important). Religious intolerance and persecution stem from this lack of <span class="kw-concept">humility</span>. <span class="kw-person">Harari</span> advocates for recognizing the <span class="kw-theme">limits of our knowledge and ability</span> and acknowledging the shared, universal nature of human capabilities as a path towards genuine <span class="kw-concept">humility</span>.</p>

                    <p><span class="kw-person">Samuel Moyn</span> argues that there's a drastic mismatch between the global crisis of <span class="kw-theme">inequality</span> and the current <span class="kw-concept">human rights</span> movement, which is not equipped to address it effectively. He begins with the parable of <span class="kw-person">King Croesus</span>, wealthy but unwilling to spend his money to end his people's suffering, as a metaphor for the modern world's unequal distribution of resources despite stated ideals. While <span class="kw-concept">Human Rights Day</span> (<span class="kw-time">Dec 10th</span>) is celebrated, little progress is made on <span class="kw-concept">distributive equality</span>. <span class="kw-person">Moyn</span> traces the history, noting the <span class="kw-time">post-WWII</span> "heroic age" of national welfare states and <span class="kw-person">Roosevelt</span>'s "Second Bill of Rights" (focused on socio-economic security) which ultimately failed to establish global <span class="kw-concept">equality</span>, partly due to <span class="kw-time">Cold War</span> partisanship. He argues that while <span class="kw-concept">human rights</span> documents claim equal rights, these are meaningless without addressing the underlying socio-political and economic structures that perpetuate <span class="kw-theme">inequality</span>. Achieving fair distribution of wealth and resources requires radical movements, which seem impractical today. <span class="kw-person">Moyn</span> concludes that the current <span class="kw-concept">human rights</span> regime focuses on <span class="kw-theme">sufficiency</span> (a basic floor) rather than <span class="kw-concept">equality</span>, leaving the world like <span class="kw-person">Croesus</span>'s: the rich enjoy maximum benefits while the poor have only illusions.

                        <div>The main goal of the <span class="kw-concept">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</span> (<span class="kw-concept">UDHR</span>), created by the United Nations in 1948, is to state clearly the basic <span class="kw-concept">rights</span> and <span class="kw-concept">freedoms</span> that belong to every single human being in the world. It lists key values like <span class="kw-concept">fairness</span>, <span class="kw-concept">dignity</span>, <span class="kw-concept">equality</span>, and respect. Its aim is to be a "common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations" and the foundation for <span class="kw-concept">freedom</span>, <span class="kw-concept">justice</span>, and peace.<br><br>This is very important for individuals because it gives them official recognition of their worth and basic needs. It says that no matter who you are, you have the right to life, liberty, safety, <span class="kw-concept">freedom</span> from torture, <span class="kw-concept">freedom</span> of thought and expression, and social protection. It empowers individuals to know their <span class="kw-concept">rights</span> and to demand them if they are being treated unfairly by governments or others. It provides a shared language and standard for fighting against <span class="kw-theme">injustice</span> anywhere.</div>

                        <div><span class="kw-person">Samuel Moyn's</span> essay "<span class="kw-concept">Human Rights</span> and the Age of <span class="kw-theme">Inequality</span>" mainly emphasizes the serious gap between the goals of the <span class="kw-concept">human rights</span> movement and the growing problem of global <span class="kw-theme">economic inequality</span>.<br><br><span class="kw-person">Moyn</span> starts with a story (parable) about a rich <span class="kw-person">king</span>, <span class="kw-person">Croesus</span>, who provides basic welfare but keeps all the wealth, creating huge <span class="kw-theme">inequality</span>. He compares this to our world, where <span class="kw-concept">human rights</span> focus on preventing bad things like torture and ensuring basic needs (a "floor of protection") but do little to challenge the massive gap between the rich and poor. He argues that the <span class="kw-concept">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</span> itself doesn't demand <span class="kw-theme">economic equality</span>. He traces how national welfare programs after WWII did aim for more <span class="kw-concept">equality</span>, but the international <span class="kw-concept">human rights</span> movement that became popular later isn't designed or equipped to fight for fair distribution of wealth.<br><br>The essay strongly emphasizes that <span class="kw-concept">human rights</span>, as they exist now, are simply not enough to solve the problem of <span class="kw-theme">inequality</span>.</div>

                        <div>Based on <span class="kw-person">Croesus</span>'s ideas as presented by <span class="kw-person">Moyn</span>, we can look at <span class="kw-concept">civil liberties</span> in <span class="kw-place">Nepal</span>. <span class="kw-person">Croesus</span>'s world ensures basic <span class="kw-concept">civil liberties</span> – <span class="kw-concept">freedom</span> from repression, police states, torture – alongside a basic welfare floor, but allows extreme <span class="kw-theme">inequality</span>.<br><br>In <span class="kw-place">Nepal</span>, the constitution guarantees many <span class="kw-concept">civil liberties</span> like <span class="kw-concept">freedom</span> of speech, assembly, religion, and protection from unlawful detention or torture. In theory, <span class="kw-place">Nepal</span> respects these basic <span class="kw-concept">rights</span> more than some countries might. However, like many places, <span class="kw-place">Nepal</span> also struggles with significant <span class="kw-theme">economic inequality</span>, <span class="kw-theme">poverty</span>, and unequal access to resources and justice. So, in some ways, the situation mirrors <span class="kw-person">Croesus</span>'s world: basic <span class="kw-concept">civil liberties</span> are officially recognized and sometimes protected, but this exists alongside deep social and economic gaps. The <span class="kw-concept">human rights</span> framework, while providing important protections, doesn't seem to effectively challenge or reduce the underlying <span class="kw-theme">inequality</span>, which affects how meaningful those <span class="kw-concept">liberties</span> truly are for many poor or marginalized Nepalis.<br><br>My view is that while <span class="kw-place">Nepal</span> has made progress on <span class="kw-concept">civil liberties</span>, like in <span class="kw-person">Croesus</span>'s world, these <span class="kw-concept">liberties</span> alone don't ensure true <span class="kw-concept">equality</span> or well-being for everyone when large economic disparities persist.</div>
